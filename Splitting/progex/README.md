# PROGEX (Program Graph Extractor)

PROGEX is a cross-platform tool for extracting well-known graphical program representations (such as 
[CFGs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow_graph), 
[PDGs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_Dependence_Graph), 
[ASTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree), etc.) from software source code. 
PROGEX is written in [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)), 
based on the [ANTLR parser generator](http://www.antlr.org).

PROGEX reads program source code files as input, and is able to generate various graphical program representations 
and export them into well-known file formats for graphs; such as 
[DOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language)),
[GML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_Modelling_Language) and
[JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON).

The structure of this repository is a Maven project.
If you are interested in contributing to this project, 
you can easily get up and running using your favorite Java IDE and Maven.

This is an internal project by members of our lab from [Amirkabir University of Technology](http://aut.ac.ir/), 
as a sub-project of the PhD thesis of [Seyed Mohammad Ghaffarian](http://linkedin.com/in/smghaffarian).


## Why We Developed PROGEX?

There are key aspects about PROGEX which makes it different and relevant in the presence of other 
well-known program analysis frameworks (such as [SOOT](https://sable.github.io/soot/), [Chord](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mhnaik/chord.html), [Spoon](http://spoon.gforge.inria.fr/), etc.):

* PROGEX is designed to operate at the source code level (or more precisely, at Abstract Syntax Tree 
  (AST) level); not any other intermediate code or machine code level. To the best of our knowledge, 
  all the above-mentioned frameworks operate at byte-code level. To explain the benefits of analysis 
  at this level, we provide the following quote:

  > Control-flow and data-flow analyses are key elements in many static analyses, and useful for a 
  > variety of purposes, e.g. code optimization, refactoring, enforcing coding conventions, bug 
  > detection, and metrics. Often, such analyses are carried out on a normalized intermediate code 
  > representation, rather than on the abstract syntax tree (AST). This simplifies the computations 
  > by not having to deal with the full source language. However, doing these analyses directly at 
  > the AST level can be beneficial, since the high-level abstractions are not compiled away during 
  > the translation to intermediate code. This is particularly important for tools that are integrated 
  > in interactive development environments, such as refactoring tools and tools supporting bug 
  > detection and coding convention violations.

* PROGEX is not a general-purpose program analysis, transformation, or rewriting framework. In contrast, 
  it is only focused on the task of extracting well-known graphical program representations, and the 
  ability to export them in well-known formats for further analysis by external programs. While all the 
  above-mentioned frameworks are able to extract well-known graphical program representations, they are 
  only internally usable, and none provide convenient mechanisms for exporting these graphs and making 
  them available to external programs.
* While the current state of PROGEX only supports the Java programming language, there is no limitation 
  to support other programming languages. Any programming language that can be parsed using the ANTLR 
  parser generator, can be supported by PROGEX. This virtually means all programming languages can be 
  supported!

After doing many searches online, we were unable to find any suitable tool with the above-mentioned properties. 
Since such a tool was a requirement for our research projects, hence we developed PROGEX.


## Usage Guide

```
USAGE:

   java -jar PROGEX.jar [-OPTIONS...] /path/to/program/src


OPTIONS:

   -help      Print this help message
   -outdir    Specify path of output directory
   -format    Specify output format; either 'DOT', 'GML' or 'JSON'
   -lang      Specify language of program source codes

   -ast       Perform AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) analysis
   -cfg       Perfomt CFG (Control Flow Graph) analysis
   -icfg      Perform ICFG (Interprocedural CFG) analysis
   -info      Analyze and extract detailed information about program source code
   -pdg       Perform PDG (Program Dependence Graph) analysis

   -debug     Enable more detailed logs (only for debugging)
   -timetags  Enable time-tags and labels for logs (only for debugging)


DEFAULTS:

   - If not specified, the default output directory is the current working directory.
   - If not specified, the default output format is DOT.
   - If not specified, the default language is Java.
   - There is no default value for analysis type.
   - There is no default value for input directory path.


EXAMPLES:

   java -jar PROGEX.jar -cfg -lang java -format dot  /home/user/project/src

      This example will extract the CFG of all Java source files in the given path and 
      will export all extracted graphs as DOT files in the current working directory.

   java -jar PROGEX.jar -outdir D:\outputs -format json -pdg  C:\Project\src

      This example will extract the PDGs of all Java source files in the given path and 
      will export all extracted graphs as JSON files in the given output directory.


NOTES:

   - The important pre-assumption for analyzing any source code is that the 
     program is valid according to the grammar of that language. Analyzing 
     invalid programs has undefined results; most probably the program will 
     crash!

   - Analyzing large programs requires high volumes of system memory, so 
     it is necessary to increase the maximum available memory for PROGEX.

     In the example below, the -Xmx option of the JVM is used to provide PROGEX 
     with 5 giga-bytes of system memory; which is required for the PDG analysis 
     of very large programs (i.e. about one million LoC). Needless to say, this 
     is possible on a computer with at least 8 giga-bytes of RAM:

        java -Xmx5G -jar PROGEX.jar -pdg ...
```


## Installation and Requirements

PROGEX is a fully portable tool and requires no installation.
Just download the latest stable release from our [**releases page**](https://github.com/ghaffarian/progex/releases).

Installing a Java Runtime Environment (JRE, version 8 or newer) is the only requirement for running PROGEX.
To acquire the latest JRE version for your platform, visit [java.com](https://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp)


## Visualizing Output Graphs

One use of the exported graphs is to visually analyze the resulting graphs for 
[program comprehension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_comprehension), 
and other analysis purposes. For this purpose there are several options:

#### 1. xdot

PROGEX can export the extracted graphs into DOT format. 
This format can be visualized using the [**xdot program**](https://github.com/jrfonseca/xdot.py).
To install `xdot` on Ubuntu, use the following command:

`sudo apt install xdot`

And visualize the resulting graph as below:

`xdot graph.dot`

An alternative way is to create an image file. This can be done as follows:

`dot -Tpng -o graph.png graph.dot`


#### 2. PROGVIZ

While `xdot` is a fine program and fulfills many basic requirements, it has some limitations.
PROGVIZ is a related project by the developers of PROGEX, which aims to overcome some of xdot's 
limitations and provide an improved modern graph visualization tool for program analysis applications.
This tool is still under active development and supports all output formats of PROGEX.
For more information, refer to its dedicated GitHub repository:
