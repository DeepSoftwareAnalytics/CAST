converts a byte to hex digit and writes to the supplied buffer
split a gts into multiple gts by cutting in ' quiet zones ' , i . e . intervals of ' quietperiod ' or more during which there were no measurements . if ' gts ' has no values or if ' label ' is already part of the labels of ' gts ' , then the resulting list of gts will only contain a clone of ' gts ' .

updates the audio track latency and playback position parameters .
answers if there is an element in this queue equals to the object .
